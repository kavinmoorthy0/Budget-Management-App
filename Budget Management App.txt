Budget Management App


User Interface (UI) for entering expenses and budgets.

Data Management to store expenses (using SQLite or Room Database).

Visualization using a chart library like MPAndroidChart to display spending by category.

Budget Alerts to notify users if their spending exceeds the set budget.

Prerequisites:

Android Studio: Make sure you have Android Studio installed.

MPAndroidChart Library: Add the MPAndroidChart library for charts.

gradle

implementation 'com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.1.0'

add latest version on it


 Project Structure

The main components of the application will be:

MainActivity.java: To handle the main UI and logic for adding expenses and setting budgets.

Expense.java: A model class for the expense.

Database (Room or SQLite): To store expense data.

Visualization (Pie Chart or Bar Chart): To show how much the user has spent by category.

2. User Interface (XML Layout)
We'll create a simple UI in XML for adding expenses, setting a budget, and visualizing spending habits.

User Interface XML file--


layout contains:

Text input fields for budget and expenses.

Buttons for adding expenses and viewing charts.

A PieChart component for visualizing expenses.


MainActivity JAVA file--

Budget Management:

Users input a budget using the setBudgetBtn. If the total spending exceeds this budget, a warning message is displayed.

Adding Expenses:

Users can input an expense category and amount. When the expense is added, it's tracked in a HashMap<String, Float> where the key is the category and the value is the total amount spent in that category.

Viewing Spending Habits:

The viewSpending() method generates a pie chart using MPAndroidChart based on the user’s spending by category.





Add Model Class 

Model Class for Expense JAVA file--

You can create a simple model class for managing expense data. Here’s an example:

Database Setup

For persistent data storage, you can use Room or SQLite to save expenses and budgets. Here is a basic example using Room:

gradle

implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:2.3.0"
annotationProcessor "androidx.room:room-compiler:2.3.0"


add latest version on it

Define the Expense entity and database setup. This step would allow the app to store data persistently and access historical expenses across sessions.
